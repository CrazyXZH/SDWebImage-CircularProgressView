Good day everybody!)
This is a category to SDWebImage that offer you to implement ProgressView in three ways:
- Circular
- Linear
- Custom

## • SCREENSHOTS

## • Installation

## • Code examples



###You should know
- Custom progress bar is a priority for other types. Otherwords if you choose `LinearPV` and then add `orCustomProgressView:(UIProgressView*)yourCustomProgressView` than it would be your custom ProgressView.
